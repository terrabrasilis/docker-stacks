## Portainer App Templates

We adopted the Portainer to manage the stacks into our Docker cluster. To turn it more easy we use the [App Templates](https://github.com/Terrabrasilis/docker-stacks/tree/master/portainer-template) to keep ours stacks definition into a public repository.

For details read [this documentation](https://portainer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/templates.html).
